Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Christopher Hutchinson, a beginner developer hoping to enter the information security field. With every project I create, I make sure I have a deep understanding of the code, only using AI for help with ideas and never for writing code.

<summary>My Journey</summary>
Growing up I always had a love for building things; from custom lego ideas to powerpoint animation stories. My passion for technology and programming was most-likely sparked by my love for videogames throughout my childhood. This passion was gradually developed by IT/Computer Science lessons throughout my school journey; from primary school all the way to university. I made my first project for my A-Level Computer Science coursework. It was an automated court scheduling web app, which included a webscraper and multi-user access. Whilst the app worked, it had many flaws and generally was not a full-proof idea, however, it sparked a passion to make more python projects. Since then I have made multiple apps in python as listed above in the 'projects' section.
